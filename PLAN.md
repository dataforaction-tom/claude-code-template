# Plan

> Last updated: [date]
> Status: [Not started | In progress | Paused | Complete]

## Objective

[What we're trying to achieve. Be specific — this is what Claude will reference when deciding what to do next.]

## Approach

[How we're going to do it. Key architectural decisions, technology choices, constraints.]

## Tasks

- [ ] Task 1 — [brief description]
- [ ] Task 2 — [brief description]
- [ ] Task 3 — [brief description]

Mark tasks with:
- `[ ]` not started
- `[~]` in progress ← add "CURRENT" marker
- `[x]` complete
- `[!]` blocked — note why

## Decisions Made

Record decisions here so future sessions don't re-litigate them.

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| [What was decided] | [Why] | [When] |

## Open Questions

- [ ] [Thing that needs resolving before we can proceed]
- [ ] [Thing that would be good to decide but isn't blocking]

## Out of Scope

Things we've explicitly decided NOT to do (yet):

- [Feature or approach we're deferring]
