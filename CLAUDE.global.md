# Global Preferences

These apply to every Claude Code session regardless of project.

## Who I Am

- [Your role — e.g. "Consultant working across multiple VCSE sector projects"]
- [Your approach — e.g. "I value practical, good enough solutions over perfect architecture"]
- [Your context — e.g. "I work in the open — default to clarity and documentation"]

## Code Style

- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Comment the "why", not the "what"
- Use meaningful variable names — no single-letter variables except in loops
- [Add your personal preferences]

## Communication

- When uncertain, say so — don't guess
- If you're about to make an architectural decision, pause and explain your reasoning
- When I say "good enough", I mean ship it — don't gold-plate
- Ask before making changes I didn't request

## Working Patterns

- Always check for existing patterns before creating new ones
- Prefer small, incremental changes over big rewrites
- If a task will take more than ~50 lines of changes, use plan mode first
- Verify your work — run builds, lints, and tests after changes

## Tools & Environment

- [Your editor, languages, frameworks]
- [Where you deploy]
- [Git workflow — e.g. "always work on branches, never commit directly to main"]

## What NOT To Do

- Don't add dependencies without asking
- Don't refactor code I didn't ask you to touch
- Don't create files without telling me what you're creating and why
- [Add things Claude has got wrong across multiple projects]

<!--
This file is loaded into EVERY session. Keep it tight.
