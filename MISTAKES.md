# Mistakes & Lessons Learned

Things that went wrong and what to do instead. This file is the most important feedback loop for improving Claude's performance on this project.

**How to use this file:**
- After every correction, add an entry here
- Tell Claude: "Add what just happened to MISTAKES.md so you don't repeat it"
- Periodically review and promote recurring patterns into CLAUDE.md as rules
- Delete entries that have been promoted to CLAUDE.md to avoid duplication
