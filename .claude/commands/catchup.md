Read all changed files in the current git branch compared to main.

Then read HANDOFF.md, PLAN.md, and STATE.md if they exist.

Give me a brief summary:
1. What has changed in the code since main
2. Where we left off (from handoff/plan)
3. What the next steps should be

Keep it concise. I want to get oriented quickly, not read an essay.
