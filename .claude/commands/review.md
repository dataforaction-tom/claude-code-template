Review your most recent changes against the project's standards. Check for:

1. Violations of coding standards listed in CLAUDE.md
2. Patterns that contradict existing code in the project
3. Missing error handling
4. Missing tests for new functionality (if tests exist in the project)
5. Anything in MISTAKES.md that you might be repeating
6. Unnecessary complexity — could any of this be simpler?

Run the project's lint command if one exists.
Run the project's build command to confirm nothing is broken.

Report what you find. If there are issues, fix them before continuing.
