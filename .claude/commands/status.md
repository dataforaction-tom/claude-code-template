Read PLAN.md, STATE.md, and HANDOFF.md (if they exist).

Give me a brief status update covering:
1. What's done
2. What's in progress (and where specifically)
3. What's next
4. Any blockers or concerns

If STATE.md has a mermaid diagram, check whether the "WE ARE HERE" marker is still accurate and update it if not.

Keep the update concise — no more than a few paragraphs.
