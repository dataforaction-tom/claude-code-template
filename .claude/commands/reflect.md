Think about what we learned during this session. Focus on session memory analysis and minimal file reading to avoid context window overflow.

1. What errors occurred and how were they resolved?
2. Did I make any mistakes that should be added to MISTAKES.md?
3. Are there patterns or rules that should be added to CLAUDE.md to prevent future mistakes?
4. Did we discover anything about the codebase that should be documented?
5. Are there any workflow improvements we should capture?

For each finding:
- If it's a mistake: add it to MISTAKES.md with the date, what happened, why it was wrong, and the rule to follow instead
- If it's a rule that should be permanent: add it to the appropriate section of CLAUDE.md
- If it's project knowledge: add it to the relevant section of CLAUDE.md or STATE.md

Show me what you've added before finishing.
